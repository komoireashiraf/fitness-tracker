# Fitness Tracker.

A simple Python-based fitness tracker that allows users to monitor their physical activities, including tracking steps, calories burned, distance traveled, and workout time. The program is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and provides an interactive console-based interface.

## Features.

- *Start/End Workout*: Tracks the active time spent during a workout.
- *Step Counting*: Users can manually add steps, which will automatically calculate calories burned and distance traveled.
- *Statistics Display*: View total steps, calories burned, distance, and workout time in a simple, formatted output.
- *User-Friendly Console Menu*: Navigate through the program using a text-based menu.
